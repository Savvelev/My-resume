            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I received a bachelor's degree in engineering - Low-temperature energy, Refrigeration, cryogenic technology and air conditioning at ITMO University.
                I tried myself everywhere, starting with installation work, ending with work in the office of the international company for the distribution of climate equipment Mitsubishi Electric (RUS).
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't find myself there. I decided to try myself in another area - in programming. I started studying on my own at the end of my undergraduate studies. After graduation I continued self-education.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of 2021, I passed an interview for admission to the EPAM System training center. Completed all test tasks, including a large final project of the WEB API of the visit log for students. I successfully passed the final interview for further employment in the company, but, unfortunately, recent circumstances did not allow me to receive an invitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am looking for opportunities to further develop as a developer in order to realize my skills for the benefit of the business.
            </p>
